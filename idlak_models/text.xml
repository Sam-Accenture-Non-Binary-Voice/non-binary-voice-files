<fileid id="f0001_002"> These gendered voices are often used in ways that reinforce counterproductive stereotypes and gender relationships.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_003"> Sometimes, technology design is lacking consideration of the long term ramifications of reinforcing gender role stereotypes.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_004"> Other times, technology is purposefully designed with gender cues that use existing binary models of human communication.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_005"> One example is using female sounding voices in subservient roles and male sounding voices in authoritive roles.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_006"> At Accenture Labs, through the Tech for Good Innovation Ecosystem, we believe technologists have a responsibility to design systems ethically.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_007"> We are helping to shape the diverse, inclusive future in which we wish to live.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_008"> Humanlike A I interfaces must be crafted in a way that offers fair representation of users.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_009"> That is why Accenture Labs is making a new generation of conversational voice assistant.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_010"> A gender neutral assistant, created by manipulating the recorded voice of a real individual to fall within the overlapping frequency range of male and female voices.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_011"> Nonbinary, or genderqueer, is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_012"> They are identities that are outside the gender binary.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_013"> Non binary identities can fall under the transgender umbrella.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_014"> This is because many non binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_015"> Non binary people may identify as having two or more genders, having no gender, moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_016"> Gender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_017"> Non binary people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as cisgender people do.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_018"> A non binary gender is not associated with a specific gender expression, such as androgyny. Non binary people as a group have a wide variety of gender expressions, and some may reject gender "identities" altogether.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_019"> Some non binary people are medically treated for gender dysphoria with surgery or hormones, as trans men and women are.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_020"> Some non binary/genderqueer people prefer to use gender neutral pronouns.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_021"> Usage of singular 'they', 'their' and 'them' is the most common.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_022"> Ze, sie, hir, co, and ey are used as well.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_023"> Some others prefer the conventional gender specific pronouns 'her' or 'him', prefer to be referred to alternately as 'he' and 'she', or prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_024"> The majority of reported discrimination faced by non binary individuals often includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_025"> People who are non binary are also often viewed as partaking in part of a trend, and are thus deemed insincere or attention seeking.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_026"> As an accumulation, erasure is often a large form of discrimination faced by non binary individuals.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_027"> Misgendering is also a problem that many individuals face, be it intentional or unintentional.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_028"> In the case of intentional misgendering, transphobia is a driving force.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_029"> Also, the use of they / them pronouns is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of safe spaces and political correctness.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_030"> This causes push back, and intentional misgendering from some individuals.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_031"> Many flags have been used in non binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_032"> There are distinct non binary and genderqueer pride flags.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_033"> The genderqueer pride flag was designed in two thousand eleven by Marilyn Roxie.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_034"> The non binary pride flag was created in twenty fourteen.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_035"> Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_036"> Purple represents those who feel their gender is a mixture of, or between, male and female. Black represents people who feel as if they have no gender.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_037"> White represents those who embrace many or all genders.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_038"> A voice frequency or voice band is one of the frequencies, within part of the audio range, that is being used for the transmission of speech.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_039"> The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from eighty five to one hundred and eighty Hertz.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_040"> That of a typical adult female is from one hundred and sixty to two hundred and fifty five Hertz.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_041"> Exponential powers of emerging digital technology sets up unprecedented opportunities to shape the future of work and solve some of society's most vexing problems.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_042"> Improving access to education and health care, achieving gender equity and other challenges are bigger than any single entity, could possibly take on alone.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_043"> But there is strength in numbers.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_044"> Only the "collective intelligence" of a synergistic ecosystem can steer the combined forces of tech for good toward the desired outcome.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_045"> Business leaders must think and act differently to find their place in these new digital ecosystems that are creating markets where none currently exist.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_046"> Indeed, innovators put themselves in position to capture part of a twelve trillion market opportunity by twenty thirty.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_047"> This report explains what we learned from examining more than thirty case studies around the use of digital technology for solving social challenges, and explains our steps to unleash Tech for Good for future growth and prosperity.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_048"> "Governments, business and civil society can't alone address the multifold challenges we have on the global agenda. We need collaboration."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_049"> Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_050"> Business leaders looking for the next big growth opportunity are unlikely to go it alone.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_051"> More likely, they'll adopt solutions developed by academic researchers and startups before building them out at industrial scale.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_052"> Additionally, businesses face challenges innovating where market mechanisms fail to function well, requiring help from civil society and government.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_053"> The upshot: Businesses must orchestrate a synergistic innovation ecosystem to reach the next billion people and capture a multitrillion dollar market opportunity.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_054"> Motivations for participating in the Tech for Good Innovation Ecosystem will vary depending on the player.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_055"> Academia will likely be driven by ideas.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_056"> Governments may seek transformational change.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_057"> Businesses must maintain a mission to create shareholder value.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_058"> Build a strong foundation of digital ethics.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_059"> Engineer solutions for the next billion.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_060"> Embed social good in business models and offerings.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_061"> Enable civil society with digital capabilities to address market cracks.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_062"> Educate to build capacity to absorb innovation for the masses.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_063"> Reimagine, reinvent how business is done.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_064"> Through the Tech for Good Innovation Ecosystem, businesses can amplify their mission and their profits by leveraging collective intelligence rather than doing it alone.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_065"> By aligning these interactions with our recommendations, it's possible for businesses to address needs of society.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_066"> They will do this with differentiated strategies powered by digital technologies and partnerships.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_067"> In doing so, businesses will discover new revenue growth models and differentiate their brands.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_068"> They'll also be contributing to building a more inclusive, fair and prosperous world.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_069"> Leading companies have seen this increasingly strong connection between trust and growth.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_070"> They are looking to advance their businesses in ways that not only meet their business goals, but also benefits people, communities and citizens.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_071"> All innovators are challenged by the question of scale.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_072"> Without scale, appropriate returns on investment are extremely unlikely.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_073"> Businesses are not only good at scaling up new innovations given their financial, technical and operational competencies.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_074"> But it is also essential for them to justify the investment and generate shareholder value. There is, however, no ready recipe for scaling innovations.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_075"> A lack of understanding of end customers and insufficient information to make strategic decisions.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_076"> An inability to adapt to a changing business and social environment, made more acute by inflexible business models.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_077"> Many projects fail to scale beyond the pilot stage due to a failure to understand the underlying social and economic context.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_078"> EMPTY</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_079"> For example, a micro banking program that established strategic ties with indigenous financial intermediaries.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_080"> It was created in order to provide mainstream financial services through mobiles and kiosks to unbanked, low income groups in Ghana.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_081"> This generated positive outcomes for the first two years of operations.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_082"> However, due to inadequate risk allocation among parties, a lack of institutional mechanisms to address loan defaults, the program had to be terminated in twenty ten.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_083"> A for profit company dedicated to using mobile technology to enable consumers to verify product authenticity at the point of purchase.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_084"> EMPTY</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_085"> It faced challenges in convincing potential clients about the risks of counterfeiting to their product offering.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_086"> Without assurance of a significant impact on sales margins and profitability, companies can be reluctant to shoulder the cost of fighting counterfeiting.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_087"> EMPTY</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_088"> The first major roll out was through a government led engagement with Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_089"> Only when it was established as a national standard did it attract the attention of multinational pharmaceutical companies.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_090"> Sustainable operations require companies and entrepreneurs to understand the cultural context and develop a structure that can work in any indigenous system.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_091"> It requires companies to dedicate necessary financial and non financial resources.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_092"> Invest time to explore ways of operating (as no single organization will be able to mobilize resources alone).</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_093"> It's important to create shared value at the intersection of financial performance and society to solve big problems.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_094"> To unlock value, companies will need to forge multi stakeholder collaboration models and incentive mechanisms.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_095"> For example, Master Card has formed multi stakeholder partnerships to advance its sustainable development agenda.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_096"> EMPTY</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_097"> Its partnership with Western Union is designed to help refugees gain access to basic goods, education, services and finances through efficient digital tools.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_098"> Another partnership resulted in the first program in Europe to distribute prepaid cards to refugees.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_099"> It provided rapid and efficient aid to refugees in Greece and Serbia through a cashless payment system.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_100"> For a sustainable operation, social innovators will need to address market needs by</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_101"> adopting a combination of business models that are either adaptive or disruptive in nature.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_102"> Businesses can amplify their mission and profitability by leveraging the collective intelligence of an Innovation Ecosystem.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_103"> An ecosystem comprised of regulators, academia, innovators and civil society, rather than doing it alone.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_104"> It will be possible for businesses to address the needs of society with differentiated strategies powered by digital technologies and collaborative partnerships.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_105"> In doing so, businesses will discover new revenue growth models and develop a differentiated brand.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_106"> They'll also be contributing to building an inclusive world that is just, fair and prosperous.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_107"> As we celebrate International Lesbian Day of Visibility, we share the stories of five proud members of the queer community.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_108"> Their examples of struggle and fulfillment are inspirational reminders of the importance of being our true, authentic selves.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_109"> "I found my voice, finally."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_110"> Program Associate Manager, Global Inclusion and Diversity Center of Expertise, India.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_111"> "There was a time when my friends and colleagues constantly asked me why I wasn't interested in getting married"</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_112"> "I evaded these questions, as I wasn't ready to come out.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_113"> My mother still believes that homosexuality is a mental illness.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_114"> I isolated myself and wanted to be invisible.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_115"> From being a rather loud person, I became quieter.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_116"> I relocated to a large city, so I'd get lost in the crowd.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_117"> "I found my voice finally, thanks to the unconditional acceptance I received from an ally, my supervisor at the company.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_118"> She was the first person that I came out to.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_119"> Today, I am happy, visible and doing work that I love."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_120"> "When you speak up, you create a safe environment for people to be themselves."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_121"> "I missed the opportunity to live my teens as a lesbian, and I believe this is the case for many of us."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_122"> "As children, we are brought up to believe that being ‘heterosexual' is the only ‘normal'.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_123"> So, when we perceive ourselves differently, there is silent self sabotage to fit the expected pattern."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_124"> Luana started her career at Accenture in two thousand eight as an analyst.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_125"> After working in various roles, she realized the importance of being visible as a lesbian and doing her part to make the world a more equal, unbiased place.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_126"> "Many queer people are shunned by their families and denied jobs after they come out. Advocacy, support and creating a safe environment are incredibly important."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_127"> "Equality concerns everybody."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_128"> Martha was a professional volleyball player when a knee injury shattered her dreams.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_129"> After this, she earned her Master's Degree in Business, worked at a startup for a year, traveled the world before joining Accenture in twenty fifteen.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_130"> She believes creating a culture of equality and psychological safety is crucial to empowering people to perform their best.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_131"> "I am passionate about inclusion because it is about visible and invisible differences, and thus concerns everybody."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_132"> "Visible lesbian leadership is immensely helpful."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_133"> "I wanted to extend a helping hand to people living in countries that need more guidance when it comes to queer issues.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_134"> As a senior leader, it's vital to be a role model to support the change"</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_135"> Christine lives in Switzerland with her wife and is a firm believer in living authentically, which allows all people to leverage their full potential.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_136"> It's powerful to be a visible, "out" leader.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_137"> She shares, "It's so important because it outlines the D N A of the company where all kinds of people are welcome and that everybody can be who they are.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_138"> And it also shows to others that you can have a successful career while being out."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_139"> "Being a good role model is being a good leader."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_140"> Security Senior Manager and Pride Network Lead.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_141"> "Leadership means to inspire, motivate and be a visible role model. Being recognized as a leader is not impacted by your role in the company."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_142"> Every day, she strives to be the leader she envisions.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_143"> Born and raised in southern Italy, Mariangela moved first to Rome and then to Milan for work.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_144"> She currently lives with her girlfriend and their cat.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_145"> Although her coming out was relatively smooth, she recognizes that's not the case with most of her colleagues.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_146"> She works actively towards building an inclusive workplace where everyone is free to be themselves.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_147"> "We need to share our stories, and promote the visibility of the queer community," she says.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_148"> "Many in the lesbian community carry immense guilt, as some are made to feel like a disappointment by loved ones."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_149"> "Creating safe spaces to share our stories is extremely helpful.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_150"> While I applaud the ever growing ally program of one hundred and sixteen thousand members, allies need to understand that they are not supporting 'us', rather they are helping to change the mindset that groups people as 'us' and 'them'.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_151"> "We do not fight to be treated differently; we want to be heard and respected as everyone else.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_152"> Some of us are feminine, some of us aren't, and some of us are both.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_153"> It doesn't change anything.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_154"> Celebrating Lesbian Day of Visibility calls the world's attention to our existence."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_155"> "Accenture is building a culture of equality.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_156"> As we get there, we need to keep up the momentum, let's continue the training and awareness programs, employee resource groups and much more.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_157"> We also need more people to get involved.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_158"> The more people supporting us, the faster we can reach our goals."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_159"> A friend of mine, who is a teacher, recently told off a student in class.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_160"> "Okay, Boomer," the student replied to titters from his classmates.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_161"> That is somewhat of a flippant phrase that's tossed around quite loosely.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_162"> At thirty five years of age, my friend in question is actually a millennial.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_163"> But the phrase is meant to mock older generations for being "out of touch" with today's most pressing issues.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_164"> The student and his classmates are children of the great recession, the climate crisis, automation and rising nationalism.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_165"> Many are justified to feel less secure about their futures, in terms of housing, jobs and the environment, than their forebears.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_166"> And it doesn't help when a Gen Z standard bearer like Greta Thunberg is often shouted down when she speaks up.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_167"> It only reaffirms her peers' concerns.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_168"> "Okay Boomer" is symptomatic of a generation who believe their views are derided, if not ignored entirely by their elders.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_169"> At a time when rampant tech progress is forcing us to ask complex ethical questions, dismissing an entire generation because of their age is nonsensical.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_170"> It's their age that makes Gen Z'ers uniquely placed to find answers to these questions.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_171"> It is symptomatic of a generation who believe their views are derided, if not ignored entirely by their elders.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_172"> Organizations today face all sorts of tech propelled challenges.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_173"> Capitalism is under pressure, with demands growing that companies find genuine purpose beyond profit.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_174"> Employees at big technology firms are taking a stand on topics such as what technologies are used in warfare.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_175"> And ride sharing companies are facing fierce opposition on workers' rights.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_176"> Somewhat ironically, technology itself fuels discontent.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_177"> "Social media makes it extraordinarily easy to join crusades, express solidarity and outrage."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_178"> Organizations would, therefore, be wise to listen closely to the views of a generation that is not just digital natives but also A I native.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_179"> However, a generational shift in attitudes means the mistrust goes both ways.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_180"> The clearest examples are in the global climate movement.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_181"> Mizz Thunberg was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for leading a global movement of young people who believe that today's leaders are falling at the first fence.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_182"> And we see the trust of today's youth in institutions, from government to media, in increasingly short and diminishing supply.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_183"> This is evident in our recent study on responsible leadership.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_184"> Gen Z'ers tend to judge leaders by the impact their decisions have on those around them, what we call stakeholder inclusion.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_185"> Older generations are more focused on what underpins decision making, mission and purpose.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_186"> We see the trust of today's youth in institutions, from government to media, in increasingly short and diminishing supply.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_187"> Disinterested, naive and weak, right?</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_188"> Wrong.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_189"> This disconnect has encouraged the rise of several myths about Gen Z.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_190"> Left unchecked, a myth can be self fulfilling, driving an even deeper wedge between generations.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_191"> Therefore, it's worth looking at the evidence: Myth number one, Gen Z'ers are disinterested.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_192"> Social media has warped their moral compass, meaning they prioritize breadth over depth in relationships.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_193"> This prevents them from truly caring about the world around them.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_194"> Reality: Mass movements such as Fridays For Future and Parkland Teens suggest social media can be used as a positive force for action.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_195"> And there are numerous other examples of Gen Z'ers looking to fix global problems.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_196"> From the sisters who took McDonalds and Burger King to task over plastic toys in kids' meals to the guy who invented a new type of cancer cell sensor, and the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, there are plenty of Gen Z'ers who are working to make the world a better place.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_197"> Myth number two: Gen Z'ers are naive.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_198"> Younger generations lead sheltered, insular lives, which robs them of the "real world" knowledge needed to solve global issues.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_199"> Reality: While experience is not to be sniffed at, the speed of technological progress makes novices out of even the most seasoned leader.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_200"> Gen Z'ers were weaned on technology, and our recent research uncovered their innovative yet pragmatic approach to addressing some of today's toughest questions about ethics and tech.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_201"> Issues covered in the research ranged from factory automation to facial recognition technologies.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_202"> Myth number three: Gen Z are overly sensitive.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_203"> Cossetted_exclude01 in their digital echo chambers, they lack empathy and resilience, making them prickly, unhelpful partners.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_204"> Reality: It's true that Gen Zers are less willing to sacrifice personal happiness for professional success and tend to report higher levels of personal challenges such as mental health.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_205"> But because the archetypical leader doesn't show vulnerability, these Gen Z behaviors are conflated with weakness.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_206"> What they're actually demonstrating is that the most basic building block of cooperation and trust, and a key trait of any good leader.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_207"> Bridge the generation gap.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_208"> Gen Z already accounts for almost a third of the global population and contains the key customers, citizens, employees and leaders of tomorrow.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_209"> Today's leaders cannot afford to ignore Gen Z in the hope that the historical correlation between age and conservativism holds.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_210"> Technological progress shows no signs of slowing down, which may well further accelerating shifts in generational attitudes.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_211"> The leaders of today should be more inclusive of Gen Z.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_212"> In addition to not dismissing tomorrow's leaders as "brats," here are three other ambitious actions we recommend taking:</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_213"> There are myriad social and collaborative tools through which you can ask for their views and insights.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_214"> From traditional social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter to newer apps like Instagram and TikTok, Gen Zers are often more accessible than older generations.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_215"> Similarly, the video sharing platform YouTube and live streaming platform Twitch are extremely popular with Gen Z.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_216"> Create profiles specifically for connecting with Gen Zers and try reaching out to popular influencers on apps like Instagram.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_217"> The key here is to encourage Gen Zers to engage with you and to make it easy for them to do so through a platform or service they're comfortable with.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_218"> Build youth in decision making groups: Greater diversity helps us to avoid groupthink.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_219"> A report from the Council of Europe on youth participation in decision making processes advises adopting more innovative methods such as digital participation, co management and co production.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_220"> These should take the place of less innovative forms such as youth councils and related bodies.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_221"> The goal is to create a space for young people to get involved, where they can share their beliefs and values and help influence decisions and outcomes that impact them.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_222"> Develop your stakeholder inclusion: Build trust by showing vulnerability.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_223"> Stand in the shoes of diverse stakeholders and foster an inclusive environment where everyone has a voice.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_224"> Take a position on pressing social issues like climate change and demonstrate empathy towards different social groups.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_225"> Stakeholder inclusion calls for leaders to express good communication, feedback and negotiation skills, plus open mindedness, listening and understanding skills.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_226"> In Tech Vision twenty, the Experience trend covers a new model to collaborate with people on their digital customer experiences.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_227"> According to our survey of six thousand business and executives globally, eighty five percent agree that to compete in a world with digital everywhere, organizations need to elevate their relationships with customers as partners.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_228"> What's particularly exciting to me with this trend is how the emergence of five G technology and Extended Reality in both consumer and business settings will enable people to choose their own adventures as they collaborate with companies on digital experiences.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_229"> This opens so many growth opportunities for enterprises to build deeper customer relationships.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_230"> But I'm getting ahead of myself.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_231"> First, let me explain what's behind the Experience trend: the necessity for personal agency in the digital journey.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_232"> As businesses strive for hyper personalization, they're gathering vast amounts of data for analytics to feed the algorithms underlying recommendation engines.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_233"> However, in the process, they're leaving no room for people to participate in their own digital experience creation.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_234"> Think how many times you get the same book, movie or song recommendation from your favorite providers, and you can't make it stop.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_235"> It quickly gets old.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_236"> By baking choice into the digital customer experience management, organizations can solve two problems at once.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_237"> First, they can give people personal agency in the moment to become co creators of their experiences, based on their current location or evolving needs.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_238"> Second, when customers actively participate in their experience choices, businesses do not need to gather and store as much data to create that highly customized experience.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_239"> This also reduces the risk of cybersecurity breaches.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_240"> Clearly, customer experience transformation is becoming an enterprise imperative.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_241"> It's also an important response to what people need and want from more human centered technology going forward.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_242"> According to our Tech Vision research, two thirds of consumers report they are just as concerned about the commercial use of their personal data as they are about security threats and hackers.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_243"> Providing personalized digital experiences helps to address this issue.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_244"> Companies are starting to recognize this trend with moves toward offering collaborative experiences.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_245"> Uber, for example, is giving riders more control over the in car aspect of the Uber experience.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_246"> In May twenty nineteen, the company added a "quiet preferred" option to its luxury Uber Black rides, allowing passengers to avoid unwanted small talk.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_247"> Later in the year, the company expanded that strategy to more riders, launching Uber Comfort, a new option that features a slew of customer preference choices, including quiet mode and temperature controls.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_248"> Filtering reality in the post digital era.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_249"> Looking ahead, this trend has longer term implications beyond replacing aging customization models.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_250"> It's about treating people as individuals and enabling them to shape their own experiences and ultimately their realities.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_251"> To do this successfully, your company will need to take on a new role.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_252"> Shifting the focus from simply making sales or providing entertainment, to how to best utilize customer input, guidelines and choices.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_253"> This capability will become even more essential as extended reality, a digital experience technology, serves as a filter between people and their experience of the world.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_254"> Case in point: Toyota is using five G and augmented reality to change what people see as they navigate daily life.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_255"> Its "Cyberverse" technology integrates with physical reality, using spatial computing, three D and ultra high definition maps.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_256"> They also use ultra realistic immersive rendering and five G to build map overlays that people can view through their mobile devices.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_257"> As this example reveals, companies increasingly must understand and work with people to create the experiences they want.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_258"> So get ready to partner with your customers on experience creation.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_259"> Provide an array of choices and become a guide, not just a provider.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_260"> And emphasize personal agency to transform your customers into active participants in the experiences.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_261"> Enjoy Thursday's weather, but don't get used to it: It's going to get cold, and snow is likely Saturday.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_262"> Yes, snow. On May ninth.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_263"> "Winter conditions return in May," the National Weather Service said Thursday. "Accumulating snow likely Friday night over the higher terrain..." The snow won't accumulate much, though. It will be less than an inch.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_264"> Friday night through Saturday Night, winter conditions return.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_265"> Accumulating snow likely tonight over the higher terrain, then blustery and unseasonably cold weather for Saturday night, more typical of March.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_266"> Thursday will be sunny, and the high temperature will be in the mid sixties.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_267"> There is a chance of rain showers overnight, when the low will dip to the low forties.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_268"> Breaking News: Connecticut has released new guidelines for state parks and beaches this summer.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_269"> The chance of rain continues Friday, when the high will get to the upper fifties.</fileid>

<fileid id="f0001_275"> The high will only reach the mid forties, and the wind chill will make it feel like thirty six degrees in Hartford during the day, and twenty eight at night. The low temperature will only be around thirty three degrees.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_276"> It will be windy at times, too.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_277"> Winds will gust as high as twenty three miles per hour on Friday and thirty seven miles per hour Saturday, the weather service said.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_278"> "Don't lose the winter jackets," Gary, chief meteorologist at the Western Connecticut State University Weather Center, said Wednesday.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_279"> Gary said the cold air is coming from Canada.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_280"> Sunday, Mother's Day, will be much brighter, although cooler than last Sunday.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_281"> It will be sunny, with a high in the mid fifties, the weather service said.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_282"> The earliest railway in Britain was a wagonway system, a horse drawn wooden rail system, used by German miners in the fifteen sixties.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_283"> A wagonway was built near Liverpool, sometime around sixteen hundred, possibly as early as fifteen ninety four.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_284"> Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit to a terminus about half a mile away.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_285"> On the twenty sixth of July eighteen o' three, Jessop opened the Iron Railway, south of London.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_286"> It is erroneously considered the first railway in Britain, but was also a horse drawn one.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_287"> It was not a railway in the modern sense of the word, as it functioned like a turnpike road. There were no official services, as anyone could bring a vehicle on the railway by paying a toll.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_288"> The Middleton Railway in Leeds, which was built in seventeen fifty eight, later became the world's oldest operational railway, albeit now in an upgraded form.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_289"> The first railway in the Americas was built in Lewiston, New York.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_290"> The first passenger tram was opened in Wales in eighteen o' seven.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_291"> Horse remained the preferable mode for tram transport even after the arrival of steam engines, well into the end of nineteenth century.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_292"> The major reason was that the horse cars were clean as compared to steam driven trams which caused smoke in city streets.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_293"> In eighteen twelve, Oliver Evans, an American engineer and inventor, published his vision of what steam railways could become:</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_294"> Cities and towns linked by a network of long distance railways plied by speedy locomotives, greatly speeding up personal travel and goods transport.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_295"> Evans specified that there should be separate sets of parallel tracks for trains going in different directions.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_296"> However, conditions in the infant United States did not enable his vision to take hold.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_297"> This vision had its counterpart in Britain, where it proved to be far more influential.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_298"> William James, a rich and influential surveyor and land agent, was inspired by the development of the steam locomotive to suggest a national network of railways.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_299"> It seems likely that James attended the demonstrative running of Richard's steam locomotive in London.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_300"> Certainly at this time he began to consider the long term development of this means of transport.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_301"> He proposed a number of projects that later came to fruition and is credited with carrying out a survey of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_302"> Unfortunately he became bankrupt and his schemes were taken over by George Stephenson and others.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_303"> However, he is credited by many historians with the title of "Father of the Railway".</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_304"> It was not until eighteen twenty five, that the success of the the world's first public railway, proved that the railways could be made useful to the general shipping public.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_305"> This railway broke new ground by using rails made of rolled wrought iron.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_306"> Such rails were stronger.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_307"> This railway was intended to enable local collieries (which were connected to the line by short branches) to transport their coal to the docks.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_308"> As this would constitute the bulk of the traffic, the company took the important step of offering to haul the wagons by locomotive power.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_309"> This is something that required a scheduled or timetabled service of trains.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_310"> However, the line also functioned as a toll railway, on which private horse drawn wagons could be carried.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_311"> This curious hybrid of a system could not last and within a few years, traffic was restricted to timetabled trains.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_312"> However, the tradition of private owned wagons continued on railways in Britain until the nineteen sixties.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_313"> The success encouraged the rich investors to embark upon a project to link the rich cotton manufacturing town of Manchester with the thriving port of Liverpool.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_314"> It was the first modern railway, in that both the goods and passenger traffic were operated by scheduled or timetabled locomotive hauled trains.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_315"> When it was built, there was serious doubt that locomotives could maintain a regular service over the distance involved.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_316"> A widely reported competition was held in eighteen twenty nine called the Rainhill Trials, to find the most suitable steam engine to haul the trains.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_317"> A number of locomotives were entered.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_318"> The winner steamed better because of its multi tubular boiler.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_319"> The promoters were mainly interested in goods traffic, but after the line opened, they were surprised to find that passenger traffic was just as remunerative.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_320"> The success of the railway influenced the development of railways elsewhere in Britain and abroad.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_321"> The company hosted many visiting deputations from other railway projects and many railwaymen received their early training and experience upon this line.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_322"> The line was, however, only thirty five miles (fifty six kilometers) long.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_323"> The earliest locomotives in revenue service were small four wheeled ones similar to the Rocket.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_324"> However, the inclined cylinders caused the engine to rock, so they first became horizontal and then, in his "Planet" design, were mounted inside the frames.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_325"> While this improved stability, the "crank axles" were extremely prone to breakage.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_326"> Greater speed was achieved by larger driving wheels at expense of a tendency for wheel slip when starting.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_327"> Greater tractive effort was obtained by smaller wheels coupled together, but speed was limited by the fragility of the cast iron connecting rods.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_328"> Hence, from the beginning, there was a distinction between the light fast passenger locomotive and the slower more powerful goods engine.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_329"> Edward refined this design and his design was popular for a number of years.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_330"> Locomotives were travelling longer distances and being worked more extensively.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_331"> The North Midland Railway expressed their concern to Robert who was, at that time, their general manager, about the effect of heat on their fireboxes.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_332"> After some experiments, he patented his so called Long Boiler design.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_333"> These became a new standard and similar designs were produced by other manufacturers, particularly Sharp Brothers whose engines became known affectionately as "Sharpies".</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_334"> The longer wheelbase for the longer boiler produced problems in cornering.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_335"> For his six coupled engines, Stephenson removed the flanges from the center pair of wheels.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_336"> For his express engines, he shifted the trailing wheel to the front.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_337"> There were other problems: the firebox was restricted in size or had to be mounted behind the wheels.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_338"> Additionally, for improved stability most engineers believed that the center of gravity should be kept low.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_339"> Railways quickly became essential to the swift movement of goods and labor that was needed for industrialization.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_340"> In the beginning, canals were in competition with the railways, but the railways quickly gained ground.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_341"> Steam and rail technology improved and railways were built in places where canals were not practical.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_342"> By the eighteen fifties, many steam powered railways had reached the fringes of built up London.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_343"> But the new companies were not permitted to demolish enough property, thereby massively increasing congestion in the city.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_344"> A Metropolitan Railway was built underground to connect several of these separate railway terminals and was the world's first "Metro".</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_345"> The railways changed British society in numerous and complex ways.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_346"> Recent attempts to measure the economic significance of the railways have suggested that their overall contribution to the growth was more modest than an earlier generation of historians sometimes assumed.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_347"> It is nonetheless clear that the railways had a sizeable impact in many spheres of economic activity.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_348"> The building of railways and locomotives, for example, called for large quantities of heavy materials and thus provided a significant stimulus to the coal mining, iron production, engineering and construction industries.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_349"> They also helped to reduce transaction costs, which in turn lowered the costs of goods.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_350"> The distribution and sale of perishable goods such as meat, milk, fish and vegetables were transformed by the emergence of the railways.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_351"> This gave rise not only to cheaper produce in the shops but also to far greater variety in people's diets.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_352"> Finally, by improving personal mobility the railways were a significant force for social change.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_353"> Rail transport had originally been conceived as a way of moving coal and industrial goods but the railway operators quickly realized the potential market for railway travel.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_354"> This led to an extremely rapid expansion in passenger services.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_355"> The number of railway passengers trebled in just eight years.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_356"> In terms of mobility and choice they added a new dimension to everyday life.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_357"> We are all about doing things faster and better around here.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_358"> And part of doing things faster and better is having a solid personal productivity system that you use on a daily basis.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_359"> This system can be just about anything that helps you get through your mountain of projects or tasks, and helps you get closer to your goals in life.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_360"> Whether it's paper or pixels, it doesn't really matter.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_361"> But, since you are reading I have to assume that pixels and technology devices are an important part of your workflow.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_362"> A personal productivity system is a set of workflows and tools that allow an individual to optimally get their work done.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_363"> Workflows can be how you import and handle your photos from your camera, how you write and create blog posts, how you deploy compiled code to a server, etcetera.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_364"> Tools are the things like planners, to do managers, calendars, development environments, applications.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_365"> You may be thinking that the more that we automate our systems, the more we will get done.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_366"> This is mostly the case, but there is one very big "gotcha" when it comes to automation of anything.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_367"> Automation is a bad thing for your personal productivity system when you don't inherently understand the process of something.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_368"> Let's take paying your bills for example.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_369"> This may seem very obvious, but if you can't stick to a monthly budget and have trouble finding the money to make payments on time, then automating your bill payment every month is completely useless and can be dangerous for your personal finances.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_370"> Another example is using a productivity tool to "tell you" what tasks are important and what to do next.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_371"> If you haven't taken a step back and figured out just how your productivity systems should work together, this type of automation will likely keep you from getting things done.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_372"> You can only automate something in your personal productivity system that have managed for a while.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_373"> If you try to automate things that aren't managed well already, you will probably feel a bit out of control and have a greater sense of overwhelm.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_374"> Another thing to remember is that some things should always be done by yourself, like responding to important emails and communicating with others.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_375"> Automating these things can show your coworkers and colleagues that you don't care enough to communicate yourself.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_376"> On the other hand, automation is a great thing for your personal productivity system when you understand the process of something and can then automatically get the steps done.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_377"> I have several workflows that I have introduced in the last year so I can be more creative and not have to worry about the details of something.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_378"> Once you open yourself up to automating a few of your processes, you start to see other pieces of your system that can benefit from automation.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_379"> Once again; none of this works unless you understand your processes and know what tools you can use to get them done automatically.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_380"> The three steps to determine if something is "ripe" for automation.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_381"> If your workflow passes these three steps, then automate it.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_382"> You can do this process in your sleep and it doesn't require your full attention.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_383"> It can (and has been) managed in some form prior to automating it.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_384"> The process is time consuming.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_385"> The process doesn't require "human finesse."</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_386"> Automating your personal productivity systems can be great for you in the long run if you are careful and mindful of what you are doing.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_387"> You first need to understand the processes that you are trying to automate before automating them though.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_388"> Don't get stuck in thinking that anything and everything should be automated in your life, because it probably shouldn't.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_389"> Pick and choose these processes wisely and you'll find the ones that take up most of your time to be the best ones to automate.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_390"> What have you automated in your personal productivity system?</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_391"> The new literature of minimalism is full of stressful advice.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_392"> Pack up all your possessions, unpack things only as needed, give away everything that's still packed after a month.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_393"> Or wake up early, pick up every item you own, and consider whether or not it sparks joy.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_394"> See if you can wear just thirty three items of clothing for three months.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_395"> Know that it's possible to live abundantly with only a hundred possessions.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_396"> Digitize your photos.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_397"> Get rid of the things you bought to impress people.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_398"> Downsize your apartment.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_399"> Think constantly about what will enable you to live the best life possible.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_400"> Never buy anything on sale.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_401"> Recently, I spent a few months absorbing the new minimalist gospel.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_402"> Having fewer possessions allows us to care for those possessions as if they had souls.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_403"> As I waded through this course of study, I felt like a dirty sponge being irradiated in the microwave:</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_404"> I was trapped, unpleasantly, but a cleansing fire was beginning to rage within.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_405"> When I went home to Texas for the holidays, I entered my parents' apartment as a whirling dervish of minimalist self satisfaction</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_406"> I hectored them to toss out their kitchen doodads and excess Tupperware.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_407"> Within hours of arrival, I had filled six large trash bags with clothes to donate.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_408"> I sounded, I imagine, like many of the converts to what might be considered the latest wave in an intermittent American impulse.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_409"> In two thousand and eight, the housing crisis and the banking collapse exposed the fantasy of easy acquisition as humiliating and destructive.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_410"> For many people, it became newly necessary and desirable to learn to rely on less.</fileid>
<fileid id="f0001_411"> It is tempting to interpret the new minimalism as a kind of cultural aftershock of that financial disruption, and perhaps it is, in part.</fileid>
