f0001_001 Alexa, Siri, Watson.
f0001_002 These gendered voices are often used in ways that reinforce counterproductive stereotypes and gender relationships. 
f0001_003 Sometimes, technology design is lacking consideration of the long term ramifications of reinforcing gender role stereotypes. 
f0001_004 Other times, technology is purposefully designed with gender cues that use existing binary models of human communication.
f0001_005 One example is using female sounding voices in subservient roles and male sounding voices in authoritive roles. 
f0001_006 At Accenture Labs, through the Tech for Good Innovation Ecosystem, we believe technologists have a responsibility to design systems ethically.
f0001_007 We are helping to shape the diverse, inclusive future in which we wish to live. 
f0001_008 Humanlike A I interfaces must be crafted in a way that offers fair representation of users.
f0001_009 That is why Accenture Labs is making a new generation of conversational voice assistant.  
f0001_010 A gender neutral assistant, created by manipulating the recorded voice of a real individual to fall within the overlapping frequency range of male and female voices.
f0001_011 Nonbinary, or genderqueer, is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine.
f0001_012 They are identities that are outside the gender binary.
f0001_013 Non binary identities can fall under the transgender umbrella.
f0001_014 This is because many non binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.
f0001_015 Non binary people may identify as having two or more genders, having no gender, moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity.
f0001_016 Gender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation.
f0001_017 Non binary people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as cisgender people do.
f0001_018 A non binary gender is not associated with a specific gender expression, such as androgyny. Non binary people as a group have a wide variety of gender expressions, and some may reject gender "identities" altogether.
f0001_019 Some non binary people are medically treated for gender dysphoria with surgery or hormones, as trans men and women are.
f0001_020 Some non binary/genderqueer people prefer to use gender neutral pronouns. 
f0001_021 Usage of singular 'they', 'their' and 'them' is the most common.
f0001_022 Ze, sie, hir, co, and ey are used as well. 
f0001_023 Some others prefer the conventional gender specific pronouns 'her' or 'him', prefer to be referred to alternately as 'he' and 'she', or prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.
f0001_024 The majority of reported discrimination faced by non binary individuals often includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.
f0001_025 People who are non binary are also often viewed as partaking in part of a trend, and are thus deemed insincere or attention seeking. 
f0001_026 As an accumulation, erasure is often a large form of discrimination faced by non binary individuals.
f0001_027 Misgendering is also a problem that many individuals face, be it intentional or unintentional. 
f0001_028 In the case of intentional misgendering, transphobia is a driving force. 
f0001_029 Also, the use of they / them pronouns is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of safe spaces and political correctness.
f0001_030 This causes push back, and intentional misgendering from some individuals.
f0001_031 Many flags have been used in non binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. 
f0001_032 There are distinct non binary and genderqueer pride flags. 
f0001_033 The genderqueer pride flag was designed in two thousand eleven by Marilyn Roxie. 
f0001_034 The non binary pride flag was created in twenty fourteen. 
f0001_035 Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary.
f0001_036 Purple represents those who feel their gender is a mixture of, or between, male and female. Black represents people who feel as if they have no gender.
f0001_037 White represents those who embrace many or all genders.
f0001_038 A voice frequency or voice band is one of the frequencies, within part of the audio range, that is being used for the transmission of speech.
f0001_039 The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from eighty five to one hundred and eighty Hertz.
f0001_040 That of a typical adult female is from one hundred and sixty to two hundred and fifty five Hertz.
f0001_041 Exponential powers of emerging digital technology sets up unprecedented opportunities to shape the future of work and solve some of society's most vexing problems. 
f0001_042 Improving access to education and health care, achieving gender equity and other challenges are bigger than any single entity, could possibly take on alone.
f0001_043 But there is strength in numbers.
f0001_044 Only the "collective intelligence" of a synergistic ecosystem can steer the combined forces of tech for good toward the desired outcome.
f0001_045 Business leaders must think and act differently to find their place in these new digital ecosystems that are creating markets where none currently exist. 
f0001_046 Indeed, innovators put themselves in position to capture part of a twelve trillion market opportunity by twenty thirty.
f0001_047 This report explains what we learned from examining more than thirty case studies around the use of digital technology for solving social challenges, and explains our steps to unleash Tech for Good for future growth and prosperity.
f0001_048 "Governments, business and civil society can't alone address the multifold challenges we have on the global agenda. We need collaboration." 
f0001_049 Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. 
f0001_050 Business leaders looking for the next big growth opportunity are unlikely to go it alone. 
f0001_051 More likely, they'll adopt solutions developed by academic researchers and startups before building them out at industrial scale.
f0001_052 Additionally, businesses face challenges innovating where market mechanisms fail to function well, requiring help from civil society and government. 
f0001_053 The upshot: Businesses must orchestrate a synergistic innovation ecosystem to reach the next billion people and capture a multitrillion dollar market opportunity.
f0001_054 Motivations for participating in the Tech for Good Innovation Ecosystem will vary depending on the player.
f0001_055 Academia will likely be driven by ideas.
f0001_056 Governments may seek transformational change.
f0001_057 Businesses must maintain a mission to create shareholder value.
f0001_058 Build a strong foundation of digital ethics.
f0001_059 Engineer solutions for the next billion.
f0001_060 Embed social good in business models and offerings.
f0001_061 Enable civil society with digital capabilities to address market cracks.
f0001_062 Educate to build capacity to absorb innovation for the masses.
f0001_063 Reimagine, reinvent how business is done.
f0001_064 Through the Tech for Good Innovation Ecosystem, businesses can amplify their mission and their profits by leveraging collective intelligence rather than doing it alone.
f0001_065 By aligning these interactions with our recommendations, it's possible for businesses to address needs of society.
f0001_066 They will do this with differentiated strategies powered by digital technologies and partnerships.
f0001_067 In doing so, businesses will discover new revenue growth models and differentiate their brands. 
f0001_068 They'll also be contributing to building a more inclusive, fair and prosperous world.
f0001_069 Leading companies have seen this increasingly strong connection between trust and growth.
f0001_070 They are looking to advance their businesses in ways that not only meet their business goals, but also benefits people, communities and citizens.
f0001_071 All innovators are challenged by the question of scale. 
f0001_072 Without scale, appropriate returns on investment are extremely unlikely. 
f0001_073 Businesses are not only good at scaling up new innovations given their financial, technical and operational competencies. 
f0001_074 But it is also essential for them to justify the investment and generate shareholder value. There is, however, no ready recipe for scaling innovations. 
f0001_075 A lack of understanding of end customers and insufficient information to make strategic decisions.
f0001_076 An inability to adapt to a changing business and social environment, made more acute by inflexible business models.
f0001_077 Many projects fail to scale beyond the pilot stage due to a failure to understand the underlying social and economic context.
f0001_078 EMPTY 
f0001_079 For example, a micro banking program that established strategic ties with indigenous financial intermediaries.
f0001_080 It was created in order to provide mainstream financial services through mobiles and kiosks to unbanked, low income groups in Ghana. 
f0001_081 This generated positive outcomes for the first two years of operations. 
f0001_082 However, due to inadequate risk allocation among parties, a lack of institutional mechanisms to address loan defaults, the program had to be terminated in twenty ten.
f0001_083 A for profit company dedicated to using mobile technology to enable consumers to verify product authenticity at the point of purchase.
f0001_084 EMPTY
f0001_085 It faced challenges in convincing potential clients about the risks of counterfeiting to their product offering. 
f0001_086 Without assurance of a significant impact on sales margins and profitability, companies can be reluctant to shoulder the cost of fighting counterfeiting.
f0001_087 EMPTY
f0001_088 The first major roll out was through a government led engagement with Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control. 
f0001_089 Only when it was established as a national standard did it attract the attention of multinational pharmaceutical companies.
f0001_090 Sustainable operations require companies and entrepreneurs to understand the cultural context and develop a structure that can work in any indigenous system. 
f0001_091 It requires companies to dedicate necessary financial and non financial resources.
f0001_092 Invest time to explore ways of operating (as no single organization will be able to mobilize resources alone). 
f0001_093 It's important to create shared value at the intersection of financial performance and society to solve big problems. 
f0001_094 To unlock value, companies will need to forge multi stakeholder collaboration models and incentive mechanisms. 
f0001_095 For example, Master Card has formed multi stakeholder partnerships to advance its sustainable development agenda.
f0001_096 EMPTY
f0001_097 Its partnership with Western Union is designed to help refugees gain access to basic goods, education, services and finances through efficient digital tools. 
f0001_098 Another partnership resulted in the first program in Europe to distribute prepaid cards to refugees.
f0001_099 It provided rapid and efficient aid to refugees in Greece and Serbia through a cashless payment system.
f0001_100 For a sustainable operation, social innovators will need to address market needs by
f0001_101 adopting a combination of business models that are either adaptive or disruptive in nature.
f0001_102 Businesses can amplify their mission and profitability by leveraging the collective intelligence of an Innovation Ecosystem.
f0001_103 An ecosystem comprised of regulators, academia, innovators and civil society, rather than doing it alone.
f0001_104 It will be possible for businesses to address the needs of society with differentiated strategies powered by digital technologies and collaborative partnerships.
f0001_105 In doing so, businesses will discover new revenue growth models and develop a differentiated brand. 
f0001_106 They'll also be contributing to building an inclusive world that is just, fair and prosperous.
f0001_107 As we celebrate International Lesbian Day of Visibility, we share the stories of five proud members of the queer community.
f0001_108 Their examples of struggle and fulfillment are inspirational reminders of the importance of being our true, authentic selves.
f0001_109 "I found my voice, finally."
f0001_110 Program Associate Manager, Global Inclusion and Diversity Center of Expertise, India.
f0001_111 "There was a time when my friends and colleagues constantly asked me why I wasn't interested in getting married"
f0001_112 "I evaded these questions, as I wasn't ready to come out. 
f0001_113 My mother still believes that homosexuality is a mental illness. 
f0001_114 I isolated myself and wanted to be invisible. 
f0001_115 From being a rather loud person, I became quieter.
f0001_116 I relocated to a large city, so I'd get lost in the crowd.
f0001_117 "I found my voice finally, thanks to the unconditional acceptance I received from an ally, my supervisor at the company. 
f0001_118 She was the first person that I came out to. 
f0001_119 Today, I am happy, visible and doing work that I love."
f0001_120 "When you speak up, you create a safe environment for people to be themselves."
f0001_121 "I missed the opportunity to live my teens as a lesbian, and I believe this is the case for many of us."
f0001_122 "As children, we are brought up to believe that being ‘heterosexual' is the only ‘normal'. 
f0001_123 So, when we perceive ourselves differently, there is silent self sabotage to fit the expected pattern."
f0001_124 Luana started her career at Accenture in two thousand eight as an analyst. 
f0001_125 After working in various roles, she realized the importance of being visible as a lesbian and doing her part to make the world a more equal, unbiased place.
f0001_126 "Many queer people are shunned by their families and denied jobs after they come out. Advocacy, support and creating a safe environment are incredibly important."
f0001_127 "Equality concerns everybody."
f0001_128 Martha was a professional volleyball player when a knee injury shattered her dreams.
f0001_129 After this, she earned her Master's Degree in Business, worked at a startup for a year, traveled the world before joining Accenture in twenty fifteen. 
f0001_130 She believes creating a culture of equality and psychological safety is crucial to empowering people to perform their best. 
f0001_131 "I am passionate about inclusion because it is about visible and invisible differences, and thus concerns everybody." 
f0001_132 "Visible lesbian leadership is immensely helpful." 
f0001_133 "I wanted to extend a helping hand to people living in countries that need more guidance when it comes to queer issues.
f0001_134 As a senior leader, it's vital to be a role model to support the change"
f0001_135 Christine lives in Switzerland with her wife and is a firm believer in living authentically, which allows all people to leverage their full potential. 
f0001_136 It's powerful to be a visible, "out" leader. 
f0001_137 She shares, "It's so important because it outlines the D N A of the company where all kinds of people are welcome and that everybody can be who they are. 
f0001_138 And it also shows to others that you can have a successful career while being out."
f0001_139 "Being a good role model is being a good leader." 
f0001_140 Security Senior Manager and Pride Network Lead.
f0001_141 "Leadership means to inspire, motivate and be a visible role model. Being recognized as a leader is not impacted by your role in the company."
f0001_142 Every day, she strives to be the leader she envisions. 
f0001_143 Born and raised in southern Italy, Mariangela moved first to Rome and then to Milan for work. 
f0001_144 She currently lives with her girlfriend and their cat.
f0001_145 Although her coming out was relatively smooth, she recognizes that's not the case with most of her colleagues. 
f0001_146 She works actively towards building an inclusive workplace where everyone is free to be themselves. 
f0001_147 "We need to share our stories, and promote the visibility of the queer community," she says.
f0001_148 "Many in the lesbian community carry immense guilt, as some are made to feel like a disappointment by loved ones."
f0001_149 "Creating safe spaces to share our stories is extremely helpful. 
f0001_150 While I applaud the ever growing ally program of one hundred and sixteen thousand members, allies need to understand that they are not supporting 'us', rather they are helping to change the mindset that groups people as 'us' and 'them'.
f0001_151 "We do not fight to be treated differently; we want to be heard and respected as everyone else. 
f0001_152 Some of us are feminine, some of us aren't, and some of us are both. 
f0001_153 It doesn't change anything. 
f0001_154 Celebrating Lesbian Day of Visibility calls the world's attention to our existence."
f0001_155 "Accenture is building a culture of equality. 
f0001_156 As we get there, we need to keep up the momentum, let's continue the training and awareness programs, employee resource groups and much more. 
f0001_157 We also need more people to get involved. 
f0001_158 The more people supporting us, the faster we can reach our goals."
f0001_159 A friend of mine, who is a teacher, recently told off a student in class.
f0001_160 "Okay, Boomer," the student replied to titters from his classmates.
f0001_161 That is somewhat of a flippant phrase that's tossed around quite loosely. 
f0001_162 At thirty five years of age, my friend in question is actually a millennial. 
f0001_163 But the phrase is meant to mock older generations for being "out of touch" with today's most pressing issues.
f0001_164 The student and his classmates are children of the great recession, the climate crisis, automation and rising nationalism. 
f0001_165 Many are justified to feel less secure about their futures, in terms of housing, jobs and the environment, than their forebears. 
f0001_166 And it doesn't help when a Gen Z standard bearer like Greta Thunberg is often shouted down when she speaks up. 
f0001_167 It only reaffirms her peers' concerns.
f0001_168 "Okay Boomer" is symptomatic of a generation who believe their views are derided, if not ignored entirely by their elders. 
f0001_169 At a time when rampant tech progress is forcing us to ask complex ethical questions, dismissing an entire generation because of their age is nonsensical. 
f0001_170 It's their age that makes Gen Z'ers uniquely placed to find answers to these questions.
f0001_171 It is symptomatic of a generation who believe their views are derided, if not ignored entirely by their elders.
f0001_172 Organizations today face all sorts of tech propelled challenges.
f0001_173 Capitalism is under pressure, with demands growing that companies find genuine purpose beyond profit. 
f0001_174 Employees at big technology firms are taking a stand on topics such as what technologies are used in warfare.
f0001_175 And ride sharing companies are facing fierce opposition on workers' rights.
f0001_176 Somewhat ironically, technology itself fuels discontent.
f0001_177 "Social media makes it extraordinarily easy to join crusades, express solidarity and outrage."
f0001_178 Organizations would, therefore, be wise to listen closely to the views of a generation that is not just digital natives but also A I native.
f0001_179 However, a generational shift in attitudes means the mistrust goes both ways. 
f0001_180 The clearest examples are in the global climate movement.
f0001_181 Mizz Thunberg was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for leading a global movement of young people who believe that today's leaders are falling at the first fence. 
f0001_182 And we see the trust of today's youth in institutions, from government to media, in increasingly short and diminishing supply.
f0001_183 This is evident in our recent study on responsible leadership.
f0001_184 Gen Z'ers tend to judge leaders by the impact their decisions have on those around them, what we call stakeholder inclusion. 
f0001_185 Older generations are more focused on what underpins decision making, mission and purpose.
f0001_186 We see the trust of today's youth in institutions, from government to media, in increasingly short and diminishing supply.
f0001_187 Disinterested, naive and weak, right? 
f0001_188 Wrong.
f0001_189 This disconnect has encouraged the rise of several myths about Gen Z. 
f0001_190 Left unchecked, a myth can be self fulfilling, driving an even deeper wedge between generations. 
f0001_191 Therefore, it's worth looking at the evidence: Myth number one, Gen Z'ers are disinterested. 
f0001_192 Social media has warped their moral compass, meaning they prioritize breadth over depth in relationships. 
f0001_193 This prevents them from truly caring about the world around them.
f0001_194 Reality: Mass movements such as Fridays For Future and Parkland Teens suggest social media can be used as a positive force for action.
f0001_195 And there are numerous other examples of Gen Z'ers looking to fix global problems.
f0001_196 From the sisters who took McDonalds and Burger King to task over plastic toys in kids' meals to the guy who invented a new type of cancer cell sensor, and the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, there are plenty of Gen Z'ers who are working to make the world a better place.
f0001_197 Myth number two: Gen Z'ers are naive. 
f0001_198 Younger generations lead sheltered, insular lives, which robs them of the "real world" knowledge needed to solve global issues.
f0001_199 Reality: While experience is not to be sniffed at, the speed of technological progress makes novices out of even the most seasoned leader. 
f0001_200 Gen Z'ers were weaned on technology, and our recent research uncovered their innovative yet pragmatic approach to addressing some of today's toughest questions about ethics and tech.
f0001_201 Issues covered in the research ranged from factory automation to facial recognition technologies.
f0001_202 Myth number three: Gen Z are overly sensitive.
f0001_203 Cossetted_exclude01 in their digital echo chambers, they lack empathy and resilience, making them prickly, unhelpful partners.
f0001_204 Reality: It's true that Gen Zers are less willing to sacrifice personal happiness for professional success and tend to report higher levels of personal challenges such as mental health.
f0001_205 But because the archetypical leader doesn't show vulnerability, these Gen Z behaviors are conflated with weakness.
f0001_206 What they're actually demonstrating is that the most basic building block of cooperation and trust, and a key trait of any good leader.
f0001_207 Bridge the generation gap.
f0001_208 Gen Z already accounts for almost a third of the global population and contains the key customers, citizens, employees and leaders of tomorrow. 
f0001_209 Today's leaders cannot afford to ignore Gen Z in the hope that the historical correlation between age and conservativism holds. 
f0001_210 Technological progress shows no signs of slowing down, which may well further accelerating shifts in generational attitudes.
f0001_211 The leaders of today should be more inclusive of Gen Z.
f0001_212 In addition to not dismissing tomorrow's leaders as "brats," here are three other ambitious actions we recommend taking:
f0001_213 There are myriad social and collaborative tools through which you can ask for their views and insights.
f0001_214 From traditional social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter to newer apps like Instagram and TikTok, Gen Zers are often more accessible than older generations.
f0001_215 Similarly, the video sharing platform YouTube and live streaming platform Twitch are extremely popular with Gen Z.
f0001_216 Create profiles specifically for connecting with Gen Zers and try reaching out to popular influencers on apps like Instagram.
f0001_217 The key here is to encourage Gen Zers to engage with you and to make it easy for them to do so through a platform or service they're comfortable with.
f0001_218 Build youth in decision making groups: Greater diversity helps us to avoid groupthink.
f0001_219 A report from the Council of Europe on youth participation in decision making processes advises adopting more innovative methods such as digital participation, co management and co production.
f0001_220 These should take the place of less innovative forms such as youth councils and related bodies.
f0001_221 The goal is to create a space for young people to get involved, where they can share their beliefs and values and help influence decisions and outcomes that impact them.
f0001_222 Develop your stakeholder inclusion: Build trust by showing vulnerability. 
f0001_223 Stand in the shoes of diverse stakeholders and foster an inclusive environment where everyone has a voice. 
f0001_224 Take a position on pressing social issues like climate change and demonstrate empathy towards different social groups. 
f0001_225 Stakeholder inclusion calls for leaders to express good communication, feedback and negotiation skills, plus open mindedness, listening and understanding skills.
f0001_226 In Tech Vision twenty, the Experience trend covers a new model to collaborate with people on their digital customer experiences.
f0001_227 According to our survey of six thousand business and executives globally, eighty five percent agree that to compete in a world with digital everywhere, organizations need to elevate their relationships with customers as partners.
f0001_228 What's particularly exciting to me with this trend is how the emergence of five G technology and Extended Reality in both consumer and business settings will enable people to choose their own adventures as they collaborate with companies on digital experiences.
f0001_229 This opens so many growth opportunities for enterprises to build deeper customer relationships.
f0001_230 But I'm getting ahead of myself. 
f0001_231 First, let me explain what's behind the Experience trend: the necessity for personal agency in the digital journey. 
f0001_232 As businesses strive for hyper personalization, they're gathering vast amounts of data for analytics to feed the algorithms underlying recommendation engines. 
f0001_233 However, in the process, they're leaving no room for people to participate in their own digital experience creation. 
f0001_234 Think how many times you get the same book, movie or song recommendation from your favorite providers, and you can't make it stop. 
f0001_235 It quickly gets old.
f0001_236 By baking choice into the digital customer experience management, organizations can solve two problems at once.
f0001_237 First, they can give people personal agency in the moment to become co creators of their experiences, based on their current location or evolving needs.
f0001_238 Second, when customers actively participate in their experience choices, businesses do not need to gather and store as much data to create that highly customized experience.
f0001_239 This also reduces the risk of cybersecurity breaches.
f0001_240 Clearly, customer experience transformation is becoming an enterprise imperative. 
f0001_241 It's also an important response to what people need and want from more human centered technology going forward. 
f0001_242 According to our Tech Vision research, two thirds of consumers report they are just as concerned about the commercial use of their personal data as they are about security threats and hackers. 
f0001_243 Providing personalized digital experiences helps to address this issue.
f0001_244 Companies are starting to recognize this trend with moves toward offering collaborative experiences. 
f0001_245 Uber, for example, is giving riders more control over the in car aspect of the Uber experience.
f0001_246 In May twenty nineteen, the company added a "quiet preferred" option to its luxury Uber Black rides, allowing passengers to avoid unwanted small talk. 
f0001_247 Later in the year, the company expanded that strategy to more riders, launching Uber Comfort, a new option that features a slew of customer preference choices, including quiet mode and temperature controls.
f0001_248 Filtering reality in the post digital era.
f0001_249 Looking ahead, this trend has longer term implications beyond replacing aging customization models. 
f0001_250 It's about treating people as individuals and enabling them to shape their own experiences and ultimately their realities. 
f0001_251 To do this successfully, your company will need to take on a new role.
f0001_252 Shifting the focus from simply making sales or providing entertainment, to how to best utilize customer input, guidelines and choices.
f0001_253 This capability will become even more essential as extended reality, a digital experience technology, serves as a filter between people and their experience of the world. 
f0001_254 Case in point: Toyota is using five G and augmented reality to change what people see as they navigate daily life. 
f0001_255 Its "Cyberverse" technology integrates with physical reality, using spatial computing, three D and ultra high definition maps.
f0001_256 They also use ultra realistic immersive rendering and five G to build map overlays that people can view through their mobile devices.
f0001_257 As this example reveals, companies increasingly must understand and work with people to create the experiences they want.
f0001_258 So get ready to partner with your customers on experience creation.
f0001_259 Provide an array of choices and become a guide, not just a provider.
f0001_260 And emphasize personal agency to transform your customers into active participants in the experiences.
f0001_261 Enjoy Thursday's weather, but don't get used to it: It's going to get cold, and snow is likely Saturday.
f0001_262 Yes, snow. On May ninth.
f0001_263 "Winter conditions return in May," the National Weather Service said Thursday. "Accumulating snow likely Friday night over the higher terrain..." The snow won't accumulate much, though. It will be less than an inch.
f0001_264 Friday night through Saturday Night, winter conditions return.
f0001_265 Accumulating snow likely tonight over the higher terrain, then blustery and unseasonably cold weather for Saturday night, more typical of March.
f0001_266 Thursday will be sunny, and the high temperature will be in the mid sixties. 
f0001_267 There is a chance of rain showers overnight, when the low will dip to the low forties.
f0001_268 Breaking News: Connecticut has released new guidelines for state parks and beaches this summer.
f0001_269 The chance of rain continues Friday, when the high will get to the upper fifties.

f0001_274 Saturday will feel more like March, the service said. 
f0001_275 The high will only reach the mid forties, and the wind chill will make it feel like thirty six degrees in Hartford during the day, and twenty eight at night. The low temperature will only be around thirty three degrees.
f0001_276 It will be windy at times, too. 
f0001_277 Winds will gust as high as twenty three miles per hour on Friday and thirty seven miles per hour Saturday, the weather service said.
f0001_278 "Don't lose the winter jackets," Gary, chief meteorologist at the Western Connecticut State University Weather Center, said Wednesday.
f0001_279 Gary said the cold air is coming from Canada.
f0001_280 Sunday, Mother's Day, will be much brighter, although cooler than last Sunday. 
f0001_281 It will be sunny, with a high in the mid fifties, the weather service said.  
f0001_282 The earliest railway in Britain was a wagonway system, a horse drawn wooden rail system, used by German miners in the fifteen sixties.
f0001_283 A wagonway was built near Liverpool, sometime around sixteen hundred, possibly as early as fifteen ninety four. 
f0001_284 Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit to a terminus about half a mile away.
f0001_285 On the twenty sixth of July eighteen o' three, Jessop opened the Iron Railway, south of London.
f0001_286 It is erroneously considered the first railway in Britain, but was also a horse drawn one. 
f0001_287 It was not a railway in the modern sense of the word, as it functioned like a turnpike road. There were no official services, as anyone could bring a vehicle on the railway by paying a toll.
f0001_288 The Middleton Railway in Leeds, which was built in seventeen fifty eight, later became the world's oldest operational railway, albeit now in an upgraded form.
f0001_289 The first railway in the Americas was built in Lewiston, New York.
f0001_290 The first passenger tram was opened in Wales in eighteen o' seven.
f0001_291 Horse remained the preferable mode for tram transport even after the arrival of steam engines, well into the end of nineteenth century. 
f0001_292 The major reason was that the horse cars were clean as compared to steam driven trams which caused smoke in city streets.
f0001_293 In eighteen twelve, Oliver Evans, an American engineer and inventor, published his vision of what steam railways could become:
f0001_294 Cities and towns linked by a network of long distance railways plied by speedy locomotives, greatly speeding up personal travel and goods transport. 
f0001_295 Evans specified that there should be separate sets of parallel tracks for trains going in different directions. 
f0001_296 However, conditions in the infant United States did not enable his vision to take hold. 
f0001_297 This vision had its counterpart in Britain, where it proved to be far more influential. 
f0001_298 William James, a rich and influential surveyor and land agent, was inspired by the development of the steam locomotive to suggest a national network of railways. 
f0001_299 It seems likely that James attended the demonstrative running of Richard's steam locomotive in London.
f0001_300 Certainly at this time he began to consider the long term development of this means of transport. 
f0001_301 He proposed a number of projects that later came to fruition and is credited with carrying out a survey of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. 
f0001_302 Unfortunately he became bankrupt and his schemes were taken over by George Stephenson and others. 
f0001_303 However, he is credited by many historians with the title of "Father of the Railway".
f0001_304 It was not until eighteen twenty five, that the success of the the world's first public railway, proved that the railways could be made useful to the general shipping public. 
f0001_305 This railway broke new ground by using rails made of rolled wrought iron.
f0001_306 Such rails were stronger. 
f0001_307 This railway was intended to enable local collieries (which were connected to the line by short branches) to transport their coal to the docks. 
f0001_308 As this would constitute the bulk of the traffic, the company took the important step of offering to haul the wagons by locomotive power.
f0001_309 This is something that required a scheduled or timetabled service of trains.
f0001_310 However, the line also functioned as a toll railway, on which private horse drawn wagons could be carried. 
f0001_311 This curious hybrid of a system could not last and within a few years, traffic was restricted to timetabled trains. 
f0001_312 However, the tradition of private owned wagons continued on railways in Britain until the nineteen sixties.
f0001_313 The success encouraged the rich investors to embark upon a project to link the rich cotton manufacturing town of Manchester with the thriving port of Liverpool. 
f0001_314 It was the first modern railway, in that both the goods and passenger traffic were operated by scheduled or timetabled locomotive hauled trains. 
f0001_315 When it was built, there was serious doubt that locomotives could maintain a regular service over the distance involved. 
f0001_316 A widely reported competition was held in eighteen twenty nine called the Rainhill Trials, to find the most suitable steam engine to haul the trains. 
f0001_317 A number of locomotives were entered. 
f0001_318 The winner steamed better because of its multi tubular boiler.
f0001_319 The promoters were mainly interested in goods traffic, but after the line opened, they were surprised to find that passenger traffic was just as remunerative. 
f0001_320 The success of the railway influenced the development of railways elsewhere in Britain and abroad. 
f0001_321 The company hosted many visiting deputations from other railway projects and many railwaymen received their early training and experience upon this line.
f0001_322 The line was, however, only thirty five miles (fifty six kilometers) long. 
f0001_323 The earliest locomotives in revenue service were small four wheeled ones similar to the Rocket. 
f0001_324 However, the inclined cylinders caused the engine to rock, so they first became horizontal and then, in his "Planet" design, were mounted inside the frames. 
f0001_325 While this improved stability, the "crank axles" were extremely prone to breakage. 
f0001_326 Greater speed was achieved by larger driving wheels at expense of a tendency for wheel slip when starting. 
f0001_327 Greater tractive effort was obtained by smaller wheels coupled together, but speed was limited by the fragility of the cast iron connecting rods. 
f0001_328 Hence, from the beginning, there was a distinction between the light fast passenger locomotive and the slower more powerful goods engine. 
f0001_329 Edward refined this design and his design was popular for a number of years.
f0001_330 Locomotives were travelling longer distances and being worked more extensively. 
f0001_331 The North Midland Railway expressed their concern to Robert who was, at that time, their general manager, about the effect of heat on their fireboxes. 
f0001_332 After some experiments, he patented his so called Long Boiler design. 
f0001_333 These became a new standard and similar designs were produced by other manufacturers, particularly Sharp Brothers whose engines became known affectionately as "Sharpies".
f0001_334 The longer wheelbase for the longer boiler produced problems in cornering. 
f0001_335 For his six coupled engines, Stephenson removed the flanges from the center pair of wheels. 
f0001_336 For his express engines, he shifted the trailing wheel to the front. 
f0001_337 There were other problems: the firebox was restricted in size or had to be mounted behind the wheels.
f0001_338 Additionally, for improved stability most engineers believed that the center of gravity should be kept low.
f0001_339 Railways quickly became essential to the swift movement of goods and labor that was needed for industrialization. 
f0001_340 In the beginning, canals were in competition with the railways, but the railways quickly gained ground.
f0001_341 Steam and rail technology improved and railways were built in places where canals were not practical.
f0001_342 By the eighteen fifties, many steam powered railways had reached the fringes of built up London.
f0001_343 But the new companies were not permitted to demolish enough property, thereby massively increasing congestion in the city. 
f0001_344 A Metropolitan Railway was built underground to connect several of these separate railway terminals and was the world's first "Metro".
f0001_345 The railways changed British society in numerous and complex ways. 
f0001_346 Recent attempts to measure the economic significance of the railways have suggested that their overall contribution to the growth was more modest than an earlier generation of historians sometimes assumed.
f0001_347 It is nonetheless clear that the railways had a sizeable impact in many spheres of economic activity. 
f0001_348 The building of railways and locomotives, for example, called for large quantities of heavy materials and thus provided a significant stimulus to the coal mining, iron production, engineering and construction industries.
f0001_349 They also helped to reduce transaction costs, which in turn lowered the costs of goods.
f0001_350 The distribution and sale of perishable goods such as meat, milk, fish and vegetables were transformed by the emergence of the railways.
f0001_351 This gave rise not only to cheaper produce in the shops but also to far greater variety in people's diets.
f0001_352 Finally, by improving personal mobility the railways were a significant force for social change. 
f0001_353 Rail transport had originally been conceived as a way of moving coal and industrial goods but the railway operators quickly realized the potential market for railway travel.
f0001_354 This led to an extremely rapid expansion in passenger services. 
f0001_355 The number of railway passengers trebled in just eight years.
f0001_356 In terms of mobility and choice they added a new dimension to everyday life.
f0001_357 We are all about doing things faster and better around here.
f0001_358 And part of doing things faster and better is having a solid personal productivity system that you use on a daily basis.
f0001_359 This system can be just about anything that helps you get through your mountain of projects or tasks, and helps you get closer to your goals in life. 
f0001_360 Whether it's paper or pixels, it doesn't really matter. 
f0001_361 But, since you are reading I have to assume that pixels and technology devices are an important part of your workflow.
f0001_362 A personal productivity system is a set of workflows and tools that allow an individual to optimally get their work done.
f0001_363 Workflows can be how you import and handle your photos from your camera, how you write and create blog posts, how you deploy compiled code to a server, etcetera.
f0001_364 Tools are the things like planners, to do managers, calendars, development environments, applications.
f0001_365 You may be thinking that the more that we automate our systems, the more we will get done. 
f0001_366 This is mostly the case, but there is one very big "gotcha" when it comes to automation of anything.
f0001_367 Automation is a bad thing for your personal productivity system when you don't inherently understand the process of something.
f0001_368 Let's take paying your bills for example. 
f0001_369 This may seem very obvious, but if you can't stick to a monthly budget and have trouble finding the money to make payments on time, then automating your bill payment every month is completely useless and can be dangerous for your personal finances.
f0001_370 Another example is using a productivity tool to "tell you" what tasks are important and what to do next. 
f0001_371 If you haven't taken a step back and figured out just how your productivity systems should work together, this type of automation will likely keep you from getting things done.
f0001_372 You can only automate something in your personal productivity system that have managed for a while. 
f0001_373 If you try to automate things that aren't managed well already, you will probably feel a bit out of control and have a greater sense of overwhelm.
f0001_374 Another thing to remember is that some things should always be done by yourself, like responding to important emails and communicating with others.
f0001_375 Automating these things can show your coworkers and colleagues that you don't care enough to communicate yourself.
f0001_376 On the other hand, automation is a great thing for your personal productivity system when you understand the process of something and can then automatically get the steps done. 
f0001_377 I have several workflows that I have introduced in the last year so I can be more creative and not have to worry about the details of something.
f0001_378 Once you open yourself up to automating a few of your processes, you start to see other pieces of your system that can benefit from automation.
f0001_379 Once again; none of this works unless you understand your processes and know what tools you can use to get them done automatically.
f0001_380 The three steps to determine if something is "ripe" for automation.
f0001_381 If your workflow passes these three steps, then automate it.
f0001_382 You can do this process in your sleep and it doesn't require your full attention. 
f0001_383 It can (and has been) managed in some form prior to automating it.
f0001_384 The process is time consuming.
f0001_385 The process doesn't require "human finesse."
f0001_386 Automating your personal productivity systems can be great for you in the long run if you are careful and mindful of what you are doing. 
f0001_387 You first need to understand the processes that you are trying to automate before automating them though.
f0001_388 Don't get stuck in thinking that anything and everything should be automated in your life, because it probably shouldn't.
f0001_389 Pick and choose these processes wisely and you'll find the ones that take up most of your time to be the best ones to automate. 
f0001_390 What have you automated in your personal productivity system?
f0001_391 The new literature of minimalism is full of stressful advice. 
f0001_392 Pack up all your possessions, unpack things only as needed, give away everything that's still packed after a month. 
f0001_393 Or wake up early, pick up every item you own, and consider whether or not it sparks joy. 
f0001_394 See if you can wear just thirty three items of clothing for three months. 
f0001_395 Know that it's possible to live abundantly with only a hundred possessions. 
f0001_396 Digitize your photos. 
f0001_397 Get rid of the things you bought to impress people. 
f0001_398 Downsize your apartment. 
f0001_399 Think constantly about what will enable you to live the best life possible. 
f0001_400 Never buy anything on sale.
f0001_401 Recently, I spent a few months absorbing the new minimalist gospel.
f0001_402 Having fewer possessions allows us to care for those possessions as if they had souls. 
f0001_403 As I waded through this course of study, I felt like a dirty sponge being irradiated in the microwave: 
f0001_404 I was trapped, unpleasantly, but a cleansing fire was beginning to rage within. 
f0001_405 When I went home to Texas for the holidays, I entered my parents' apartment as a whirling dervish of minimalist self satisfaction
f0001_406 I hectored them to toss out their kitchen doodads and excess Tupperware. 
f0001_407 Within hours of arrival, I had filled six large trash bags with clothes to donate.
f0001_408 I sounded, I imagine, like many of the converts to what might be considered the latest wave in an intermittent American impulse. 
f0001_409 In two thousand and eight, the housing crisis and the banking collapse exposed the fantasy of easy acquisition as humiliating and destructive. 
f0001_410 For many people, it became newly necessary and desirable to learn to rely on less. 
f0001_411 It is tempting to interpret the new minimalism as a kind of cultural aftershock of that financial disruption, and perhaps it is, in part. 
f0001_412 But, at the same time that her cohort have popularized a form of material humility, minimalism has become an increasingly aspirational and deluxe way of life. 
f0001_413 Less is more attractive when you've got a lot of money. 
f0001_414 Minimalism is easily transformed from a philosophy of intentional restraint into an aesthetic language through which to assert a form of walled off luxury.
f0001_415 It becomes a self centered and competitive impulse that is not so different from the acquisitive attitude that minimalism purports to reject.
f0001_416 It is rarely acknowledged that many people have minimalism forced upon them by circumstances that render impossible a serene, jewel box life style. 
f0001_417 Nor do they mention that poverty and trauma can make frivolous possessions seem like a lifeline rather than a burden. 
f0001_418 Many of today's gurus maintain that minimalism can be useful no matter one's income, but the audience they target is implicitly affluent.
f0001_419 The pitch is never about making do with less because you have no choice. 
f0001_420 Today's minimalism, with its focus on self improvement, feels oddly dominated by a logic of accumulation. 
f0001_421 Writing in search of the things that popular minimalism sweeps out of the frame, he surveys minimalist figures in art, music, and philosophy.
f0001_422 Along the way, he offers sharp critiques of things oriented minimalism. 
f0001_423 The sleek, simple devices produced by Apple rely on a hidden maximalist assemblage. 
f0001_424 Also, he points out, the glass walls in Apple's headquarters were marked with Post it notes to keep employees from smacking into them, like birds. 
f0001_425 The self help minimalists say that keeping expenses low and purchases to a minimum can help create a life that is clear and streamlined. 
f0001_426 This practice can also lead to the conclusion that there is not only too much stuff in your apartment but too much stuff in the world.
f0001_427 There is, you might say, an epidemic of overproduction. 
f0001_428 If you did say this, you would be quoting Karl Marx.
f0001_429 Today's most popular minimalists do not mention Marx. 
f0001_430 Sometimes they address the importance of freeing oneself from the dictates of the market. 
f0001_431 But they avoid discussing the more common situation of having your wages kept low against your will. 
f0001_432 They also assure their audience that "capitalism is not broken", we are. 
f0001_433 Even these sincere prophets of anti consumerism are hesitant to conclude that the excessive purchasing of stuff may be a symptom of larger structural problems.
f0001_434 Or that a life built around maximum accumulation may be not only insufficiently conducive to happiness but actually, morally bad.
f0001_435 The worst versions of life style minimalism frame simplicity not as a worthy end in itself but as an instrument.
f0001_436 It is a vision shaped by the logic of the market.
f0001_437 The self is perpetually being improved.
f0001_438 Its environment is ready for public display and admiration.
f0001_439 It methodically sheds all inefficiencies and flaws. 
f0001_440 This vision also forgoes any recognition that the kind of salvation so many people are seeking can happen only at the level of the system rather than at that of the individual. 
f0001_441 The difference between profound and superficial minimalism may be a matter of conceptual inversion.
f0001_442 The question is whether you accept diminishment in order to more efficiently assert your will.
f0001_443 Or whether you assert your will in order to accept the unseen bounty of self diminishment. This is also where the minimalism of ideas meets the minimalism of things.
f0001_444 The latter argues that ridding yourself of possessions means ridding yourself of trouble and difficulty.
f0001_445 The former suggests that the end point of stripping away excess is the realization that the world is more troubled and also more wondrous and full of possibility than it seems.
f0001_446 In the early twenties, hundreds of thousands of railway workers went on strike, and more than a dozen people died in clashes between strikers and armed guards. 
f0001_447 Gregg, devastated, came across a book of Gandhi's writings in a Chicago bookstore, and travelled to India to meet Gandhi and learn about peaceful resistance. 
f0001_448 In nineteen thirty four, he published "The Power of Nonviolence," which Martin Luther King, Junior., later described as one of the books that had had the greatest influence on him. 
f0001_449 Several years ago, Diane, published a paper arguing that we can "awaken ourselves from the dream of limitless material growth and actively invent new ways to live within the material limits of the Earth." 
f0001_450 This is, in the end, the most convincing argument for minimalism: with less noise in our heads, we might hear the emergency sirens more clearly. 
f0001_451 If we put down some baggage, we might move more swiftly. 
f0001_452 We might address the frantic, frightening, intensifying conditions that have prompted us to think of minimalism as an  attractive escape.
f0001_453 Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those with identities outside the binary.
f0001_454 That is, they're failing to lead in addressing the climate crisis, leaving their children and grandchildren to bear the consequences.
f0001_455 When you know how to manage something effectively and understand the step by step process of a portion of your system, it's probably a great time to automate it.
f0001_456 She writes about the importance of figuring out your minimum required monthly income, and encourages readers to consider the environmental consequences of their life styles. 
f0001_457 They also write about the joy that comes from choosing to earn less money.
